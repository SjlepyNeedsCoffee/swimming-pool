  <p>On the 4th of July 2024, a rich man died. His funeral was attended by many, but few close friends and fewer relatives. The next day, a hearing of his last will and testament was conducted by his lawyer, attended by every nobody. The lawyer spoke in a dragged, dry, and airy speech that soaked any grief in the room. He spoke without a pause or a moment to correct his misspoken words. The dead man had once graduated from a college without a pool. Hence, he stated in his will: 
  <br>
  “Conditionally, a percentage, as seen fit from my equity, will be donated to the party annually solely to build, maintain, expand, improve, sanitize, and relocate a swimming pool for the students of the college to use perpetually. To ensure proper usage of the funds, a student-led committee of 70 students must be made that reviews, ensures funds are allocated solely to the pool, and makes suggestions to fund the pool efforts. To eradicate any misuse of power, a student-led committee of 70 students must be made that ensures that the student-led committee is free of corruption, including bribery in the form of non-monetary means, unliable decisions, and specific actions that jeopardize the swimming pool. To pick members of this committee, a student-led committee of 30 members must be made that selects applicants for this committee to the best of their ability.”  
  <br>
  In 7 months, the college was shut down due to “low admission applications and a dwindling student population.” The profits were won in an arbitration and split evenly among board members.</p>
